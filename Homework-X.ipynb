    "# 2. Radiation from Radon (Rn)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.a. The average home in the US has ~ 0.019 pico-grams ($10^{-12}$ g) of $Rn/m^3$. What is the corresponding activity, in $Bq/m^3$?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.b. If we assume all of the short half-life daughters following the Rn decay to be part of the same disintegration, how much energy is being produced by this activity? (in units of $MeV/m^3/s$) Use the decay table provided on slide 34.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.c. Use the [live chart](https://www-nds.iaea.org/relnsd/vcharthtml/VChartHTML.html) to update your answer to include all significant decay modes and secondary gamma radiation (neglect x-rays)\n",
    "  * Hint: The total will be a weighted (by branching ratio) sum of all decay products.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.d. In a 25 $m^3$ room, how much energy is being produced from Radon? How does this compare to a ~10W (Joules/s) LED light bulb?\n"
