Remember, because this is showing CPM, the uncertainties shown are not going to be related to the measured CPM in the same way they would be if this were showing total counts. However, these uncertainties should still be showing the 1-sigma range for a Gaussian distribution. With that in mind, are these points fluctuating as expected given the shown uncertainties?
