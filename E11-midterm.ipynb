    "When asked for specific quantities, use python to do any calculations necessary and print out your answer with some text describing the answer. Include the units for your answer and any other relevant information.\n",

    "Submit your Midterm by copying this notebook to your git repository, adding your answer, and committing your modified notebood to your repository. Being able to complete these steps and commit/push your work to your repo so that it is visible on GitHub is part of the midterm and will be part of your grade. If you need help from Chris or I with this step, that will be considered in your grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A few useful pieces of information:\n",
    "For the purposes of these questions here are some assumptions we will make if a radioisotope source is inside the human body:\n",
    "* All alpha and beta particles are fully absorbed\n",
    "* The source is assumed to be in the center of the body and the attenuation of gamma radiation is determined using the assumption that the body is a sphere of water:\n",
    "  * $\\int_{0.001}^{30}\\frac{e^{-\\mu r}}{(4\\pi r^2)}$ = 0.79\n",
    "  * where $\\mu = 0.036/cm$ and $r = 30cm$\n",
    "  * Therefore, all gamma radiation sources inside the body should include a multiplicative factor of $0.79$ when determining the absorbed or effective dose.\n",
    "* For sources outside the body, the absorbed dose from gamma radiation should include a correction for attenuation of $0.5$ (this is a very rough approximation)"
