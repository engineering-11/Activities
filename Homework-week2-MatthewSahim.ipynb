    "- Everyday, humans intake radioactive materials through the atmosphere and the food we eat. As carbon based organisms, we contain Carbon-14 (a radioactive isotope) within us. An essential element to our bodily functions that we consume is potassium. Potassium also has a radioactive isotope of Potassium-40. WIthin the air we breathe contains other radioactive isotopes such as Radon-226 and Radon-228. Other elements such as Lead-210 and Uranium-238 can be found in foods we eat in addition. All these elements and more add up to a radioactivity equal to the sum of these individually radioactive isotopes."
